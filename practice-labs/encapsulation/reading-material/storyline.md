A survey is being conducted by the government. The purpose of the survey is to gather the information of all the people working in India, so as to find the average salary and age. By gathering this form of information, government wants to observe as which section of people earns how much on an average.
Your task is to create a system, through which we can gather all the information like -

of a person, and then use these information for further analytics work.
In this system, make sure that no negative value is being accepted for age and salary.
